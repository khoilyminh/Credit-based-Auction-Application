15. Automatic bid limit:
(a) Bid limit functionality: Buyers can set an automatic bid limit for an item they are bidding
on. The application will automatically increment their bid until their set limit is reached.
For example, let’s say an item A has a bid increment of 10 CP.
Scenario (1):
i. Buyer XXX placed an initial bid of 50 and set a bid limit of 90.
ii. Buyer YYY placed a bid of 60. The application automatically places a bid of 70 for
buyer XXX.
iii. Buyer ZZZ placed a bid of 80. The application automatically places a bid of 90 for
buyer XXX again.
iv. Buyer WWW placed a bid of 100. Since buyer XXX’s limit is 90, no further automatic
bid is placed.
(b) Automatic bid limit conflict: Automatic bid limits cannot be identical for multiple buyers
on the same auction item. If a new buyer sets an automatic bid limit equal to an existing
bid limit, the application will reject the limit and prompt them to adjust the limit to the next
available bid increment. Scenario (2):
i. Buyer XXX sets an automatic bid limit of 90.
ii. Buyer WWW tries to set the same limit of 90.
iii. The application rejects buyer WWW’s limit and prompts to change it to 100, as the bid
increment is 10.
